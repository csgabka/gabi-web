		<p>Welcome.</p>
		<p>I have created this website to collect all the projects I have been working on recently as a portfolio work.</p>
		<p>I have been living in London since 2010, I was born in Hungary - this is where I graduated as a Computer Engineer (BSc) in 2010 at Jon Von Neumann University. Since I have moved to London, I have been working as a Retail Manager which has given me many challenges during these past ten years and many career opportunities as well.</p>
		<p>It has always been at the back of my mind that I have graduated in IT but I have chosen to work in a completely different field where I use almost none of the knowledge I have gained during those years when I was studying. I was led by a misconcept that without years of commercial experience in IT I would never get a job to start off - but everyone at some point in their life had zero experience in whatever they do now, right? Whenever I decided to start finding the path to get into IT (eg. I have completed a Web Developer course on Udemy in 2018 while working as a Retail Manager full-time) a new promotion or a new job opportunity, or a pay rise come into my way.</p>
		<p>2020 became a year what nobody was expecting - using this unprecedented time I have decided to start building my portfolio again and putting a lot of effort into coding. It is now the perfect time to make a career change and move into a field which was always attracting me - since I was a kid. </p>
		<p>I hope you are going to enjoy browsing my projects. Any kind of feedback is appreciated. </p>
		<p>KR,</p><p>Gabi</p>
